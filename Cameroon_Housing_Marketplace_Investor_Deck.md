# Executive Summary

## The Opportunity

Cameroon's residential rental market is a **$790M-$1B USD annual opportunity** (490B-625B XAF) in Douala and Yaoundé alone, growing at **10.35% annually**. Yet the market remains fragmented, opaque, and trust-deficient—dominated by Facebook groups, informal agents, and word-of-mouth.

**Our Solution:** A two-sided marketplace connecting verified landlords with quality tenants, solving the three core frictions: **discovery** (fragmented channels), **trust** (no verification), and **payment** (6-12 month upfront burden).

## The Market

- **Market Size:** 490B-625B XAF ($790M-$1B USD) annual rental spend in primary markets
- **Growth Rate:** 10.35% CAGR (2025-2029)
- **Pain Points:** 2.5M+ housing deficit, 50+ years to afford home, no standardized verification
- **Current State:** 60-70% of transactions are informal, fraud-ridden, inefficient

## Our Competitive Advantage

1. **Trust-First Verification:** Property visits + ownership checks + tenant screening
2. **Payment Innovation:** Pay-as-you-go rent collection via Mobile Money (addresses upfront burden)
3. **Renter-First UX:** Superior search, transparent pricing, verified listings
4. **Local Execution:** Deep Cameroon market knowledge, agent partnerships, cultural fit

# 2. Problem Statement

## 2.1 The Core Problem

Cameroon's residential rental market is **fragmented, opaque, and trust-deficient**. Renters struggle to find verified properties, mobilize upfront payments, and avoid scams. Landlords struggle to find quality tenants, collect rent efficiently, and manage properties.

**Current State:**

- **60-70% of transactions are informal** (Facebook groups, WhatsApp, word-of-mouth)
- **No standardized verification** (property ownership, tenant screening)
- **Agent exploitation** (1-2 months rent as fee, no loyalty to renter)
- **Upfront payment burden** (6-12 months + 1-2 months caution = 800K-1.4M XAF for 100K/month apartment)
- **Fraud common** (bait-and-switch, fake listings, unverified owners)

## 2.2 Why Existing Solutions Fail

| Solution                 | Market Share | Why It Fails                                                       |
| ------------------------ | ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Facebook Groups**      | ~50-60%      | No verification, scams, no search, posts disappear                 |
| **WhatsApp Broadcasts**  | ~20-30%      | Spam, no organization, can't search history                        |
| **Démarcheurs (Agents)** | ~30-40%      | High fees (1-2 months), no loyalty, show same property to multiple |
| **Word-of-Mouth**        | ~40-50%      | Limited to network, excludes newcomers, slow                       |
| **Formal Platforms**     | <5%          | Early stage, low adoption, unclear verification                    |

## 2.3 The Cost of the Problem

**For Renters:**

- **Time:** 2-4 weeks to find housing (vs. 1 week with platform)
- **Money:** Agent fees (1-2 months rent = 100K-600K XAF), overpaying due to lack of price transparency
- **Risk:** Scams, bait-and-switch, no recourse

**For Landlords:**

- **Vacancy:** 1-3 months average vacancy = 100K-900K XAF lost rent
- **Bad Tenants:** No screening = late payments, property damage, eviction costs
- **Inefficiency:** Manual rent collection, no management tools

**Total Market Inefficiency:** Estimated **50B-100B XAF annually** in wasted fees, vacancy, and fraud.

## 3.3 Innovation: Leapfrog, Not Digitize

### 1. Unbundle the Upfront Payment Problem

**Current State:** Renters must pay 6-12 months + 1-2 months caution upfront (800K-1.4M XAF for 100K/month apartment). Many can't mobilize this capital.

**Our Solution:**

- **Pay-as-you-go rent collection:** Monthly collection via Mobile Money, platform holds and disburses to landlord
- **Deposit insurance (Phase 2):** Renter pays small premium, insurer covers caution
- **Rent financing (Phase 3):** Partner with MFIs for rent-to-own or payment plans

**Revenue Model:**

- Transaction fee: 1-2% of rent collected
- Float interest (if holding funds)
- Insurance premium (if offering deposit insurance)

### 2. Create Trust Where None Exists

**Current State:** No standardized verification. Landlords rely on "he's from my village." Renters can't verify property ownership.

**Our Solution:**

- **Verified Listings:** Property visit + photo/video + ownership document check
- **Tenant Scoring:** Employment verification, rent history, references
- **Landlord Ratings:** Post-tenancy reviews
- **Escrow Payments:** Funds released after move-in confirmed

**Competitive Moat:** Verification quality becomes brand differentiator. Hard to replicate without boots-on-ground.

### 3. Capture Value Others Ignore

**Data Play:**

- Cameroon's most accurate rental price database (by neighborhood, property type)
- Monetize via: market reports, APIs, consulting (developers, banks, urban planners)

**Landlord SaaS:**

- Multi-property dashboard
- Rent collection tracking
- Maintenance request management
- Tenant communication

**Adjacent Services:**

- Moving services (partnerships)
- Furniture rental
- Utility setup (ENEO, CamWater)
- Home insurance

# 9. Risk Analysis & Mitigation

## 9.1 Top Risks

| Risk                                                  | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation                                                                                                                               |
| ----------------------------------------------------- | ---------- | ------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Chicken-and-egg (no listings → no renters)**        | High       | High   | Seed with 200-500 verified listings via agent partnerships. Free listings initially. Aggressive marketing to renters.                    |
| **Kasastay reaches critical mass first**              | Medium     | High   | Move fast. Differentiate on verification quality, payment innovation. Consider niche focus (students, diaspora).                         |
| **Trust breach (fraud on platform)**                  | Medium     | High   | Strict verification. Escrow for first transactions. Clear refund policy. Insurance partner for edge cases.                               |
| **Landlords bypass platform after first transaction** | High       | Medium | Create ongoing value: rent collection, tenant management, lease renewal reminders. Make platform stickier.                               |
| **Mobile Money integration fails/delays**             | Medium     | Medium | MTN MoMo API is documented but support is slow. Budget 3-6 months. Have manual fallback (bank transfer, cash pickup).                    |
| **Low willingness to pay (users expect free)**        | Medium     | Medium | Charge landlords, not renters (initially). Landlords pay for premium placement, verification, tenant screening. Renters free or low fee. |
| **Regulatory changes**                                | Low        | Medium | Monitor regulatory environment. Engage with regulators. Legal advisor on retainer.                                                       |
| **Economic downturn**                                 | Low        | High   | Rental market is defensive (people always need housing). Focus on affordable segment. Flexible payment options.                          |

## 9.2 Risk Mitigation Strategies

### Trust & Fraud Prevention

**Multi-Layer Verification:**

1. Property visit (photo/video, location check)
2. Ownership document review (title deed, ID)
3. Neighborhood verification (safety, amenities)
4. Landlord background check (references, reviews)

**Escrow System:**

- First payment held in escrow
- Released after move-in confirmed (both parties)
- Dispute resolution process

**Insurance Partner:**

- Deposit insurance (renter pays premium, insurer covers caution)
- Fraud protection (platform liability insurance)

### Competitive Response

**If Kasastay Scales Faster:**

- Differentiate on verification quality (more thorough)
- Payment innovation (pay-as-you-go, rent financing)
- Niche focus (students, diaspora, affordable housing)
- Lower fees (undercut if necessary)

**If Facebook Improves:**

- Emphasize verification (they can't do this)
- Payment integration (they don't have this)
- Trust signals (reviews, ratings, escrow)

### Operational Resilience

**Backup Plans:**

- Manual verification if automated fails
- Cash pickup if Mobile Money down
- WhatsApp support if app crashes
- Agent network if platform fails

**Disaster Recovery:**

- Data backups (daily)
- Redundant servers
- Customer support escalation process
