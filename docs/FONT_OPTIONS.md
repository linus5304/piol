## My Recommendation for Piol

**Primary: Plus Jakarta Sans** (headings + body)  
**Why:** It has the right balance of modern/professional for a housing marketplace that handles money. It's readable in French and English, looks good at all sizes, and conveys trustworthiness.

**Alternative: DM Sans** if you want a slightly friendlier, more approachable feel.
