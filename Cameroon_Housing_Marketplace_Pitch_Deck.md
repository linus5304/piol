**Slide 2: The Problem**

# The Problem: A $1B Market That's Broken

## For Renters

- ❌ **Opaque pricing** - Hidden fees, agent exploitation
- ❌ **6-12 month upfront payment** - Can't mobilize capital
- ❌ **No verification** - Scams, bait-and-switch common
- ❌ **Fragmented search** - Facebook, WhatsApp, word-of-mouth

## For Landlords

- ❌ **No tenant screening** - Bad tenants, late payments
- ❌ **Rent collection friction** - Cash, bank transfers inefficient
- ❌ **Property sits vacant** - Slow discovery, limited reach
- ❌ **No management tools** - Manual, error-prone

**Current State:** 60-70% of transactions are informal, fraud-ridden, inefficient

**Slide 3: The Opportunity**

# $1B+ Annual Market Opportunity

## Market Size (Douala + Yaoundé)

- **490B-625B XAF** ($790M-$1B USD) annual rental spend
- **10.35% CAGR** (2025-2029) - fastest growing segment
- **2.5M+ housing deficit** - massive unmet demand
- **56.5% urbanization** → 70% by 2050

## Market Pain

- **50+ years** to afford a home (least affordable globally)
- **No standardized verification** - trust deficit
- **Fragmented channels** - Facebook groups, agents, word-of-mouth

**The Opportunity:** First-mover advantage in a massive, underserved market

---

**Slide 4: Our Solution**

# A Trust-First, Two-Sided Marketplace

## For Renters

✅ **Verified Listings** - Property visits + ownership checks = no scams  
✅ **Superior Search** - Filter by location, price, amenities  
✅ **Transparent Pricing** - No hidden fees, agent exploitation eliminated  
✅ **Payment Innovation** - Pay-as-you-go rent collection (addresses upfront burden)  
✅ **Trust Signals** - Landlord reviews, property photos/videos

## For Landlords

✅ **Quality Tenants** - Employment verification, rent history, references  
✅ **Faster Occupancy** - Reduce vacancy from 2-3 months to 2-4 weeks  
✅ **Rent Collection Tools** - Mobile Money integration, automated reminders  
✅ **Lower Fees** - 5% commission vs. 1-2 months (8-16%) from agents  
✅ **Property Management** - Multi-property dashboard, tenant communication

---

**Slide 5: Innovation: Leapfrog, Not Digitize**

# We Don't Digitize - We Leapfrog

## 1. Unbundle the Upfront Payment Problem

**Current:** Renters pay 6-12 months + 1-2 months caution upfront (800K-1.4M XAF)  
**Our Solution:** Pay-as-you-go rent collection via Mobile Money  
**Impact:** Opens market to renters who can't mobilize capital

## 2. Create Trust Where None Exists

**Current:** No standardized verification, fraud common  
**Our Solution:** Property visits + ownership checks + tenant screening + escrow  
**Impact:** Eliminates scams, builds platform trust

## 3. Capture Value Others Ignore

**Data Play:** Cameroon's most accurate rental price database  
**SaaS Upsell:** Property management tools for landlords  
**Adjacent Services:** Moving, furniture, insurance

**Competitive Moat:** Verification quality + payment innovation = hard to replicate

**Slide 7: Unit Economics**

# Unit Economics Are Viable

## Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)

- **Landlords:** 30K-80K XAF ($48-130 USD)

## Lifetime Value (LTV)

  - 1-2 transactions/year × 18-24 months
- **Landlords:** 300K-600K XAF ($480-970 USD)
  - Premium listing + commission

## LTV:CAC Ratio

- **Renters:** 1.25:1 to 13:1 (target: 3:1+)
