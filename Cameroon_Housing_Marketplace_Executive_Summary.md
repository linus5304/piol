# Cameroon Housing Marketplace

## Executive Summary - One Pager

**Confidential - For Investor Review Only**

---

## The Opportunity

Cameroon's residential rental market is a **$790M-$1B USD annual opportunity** (490B-625B XAF) in Douala and Yaoundé alone, growing at **10.35% annually**. Yet the market remains fragmented, opaque, and trust-deficient—dominated by Facebook groups, informal agents, and word-of-mouth.

**Our Solution:** A two-sided marketplace connecting verified landlords with quality tenants, solving discovery, trust, and payment frictions through property verification, pay-as-you-go rent collection, and superior UX.

---

## Market Size

- **TAM:** $323B USD (Cameroon real estate market by 2025)
- **SAM:** $790M-$1B USD (residential rentals in Douala + Yaoundé)
- **Growth:** 10.35% CAGR (2025-2029)
- **Pain:** 2.5M+ housing deficit, 50+ years to afford home, no standardized verification

---

## The Problem

**For Renters:** Opaque pricing, 6-12 month upfront payments, no verification (scams common), fragmented search  
**For Landlords:** No tenant screening, rent collection friction, property sits vacant, no management tools

**Current State:** 60-70% of transactions are informal, fraud-ridden, inefficient

---

## Our Solution

**Trust-First Marketplace:**

- Verified listings (property visits + ownership checks)
- Pay-as-you-go rent collection (addresses upfront burden)
- Superior search (filter by location, price, amenities)
- Tenant screening (employment verification, rent history)
- Mobile Money integration (MTN MoMo, Orange Money)

**Competitive Advantage:** Verification quality + payment innovation = hard to replicate

---

## Business Model

**Revenue Streams:**

- Premium listings: 10K-20K XAF/month
- Transaction commission: 5% of annual rent
- Tenant screening: 5K-10K XAF per screening

**Year 1 Revenue:** 54M XAF ($87K USD) - Conservative (0.5% market penetration)  
**Year 3 Revenue:** 200M+ XAF ($323K+ USD) - Optimistic (2% market penetration)

**Unit Economics:**
